This is a reusable test file to see how well Hugo handles rendering images. Don't even bother reading further as most of this is just nonsesne I am typing out to pad out stuff to see how everything looks.

Dig Dug[a] is a 1982 maze arcade game developed and published by Namco. It was distributed by Atari, Inc. in North America and Europe. Controlling the titular character, the player is tasked with defeating all of the enemies in each stage, done by either inflating them with air with a pump until they pop or crushing them underneath large rocks. It ran on the Namco Galaga arcade board.

Dig Dug was programmed by Shouichi Fukatani, who worked on many of Namco's earlier arcade titles, and designed by junior colleagues of Galaga creator Shigeru Yokoyama. Music was composed by Yuriko Keino, becoming the first game she worked on for Namco â€” the short jingle made when the character moved was made when executives wanted a walking sound in the game. It was described as a "strategic digging game" by Namco for its large amount of strategy used to defeat enemies, which was heavily used in the game's marketing.

Upon release, Dig Dug was well-received by critics for its addictive gameplay, cute characters and strategy, and was a popular title during the golden age of arcade video games. It was met with a long series of sequels and spin-offs for several platforms, alongside ports for home consoles and digital storefronts. Dig Dug is also included in many Namco video game compilations for a number of systems. Characters from the game appear throughout the Mr. Driller series, itself based on the Dig Dug gameplay.
