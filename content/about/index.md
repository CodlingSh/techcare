We are two young women who see a real need in our community—to protect and educate people of all ages and tech abilities in today’s fast-moving digital world.

Our goal is to make technology feel less overwhelming and more empowering. Whether it's learning how to use a device, setting up an app, or understanding how to spot online scams, we're here to offer patient, one-on-one support that meets people where they’re at.

We believe everyone deserves to feel confident and safe online. Through friendly guidance, clear explanations, and a no-judgment approach, we’re building a more connected, informed, and scam-smart community—one person at a time.
